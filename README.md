# The Art Of Words

an individual project for Madison College's Enterprise Java Class

## Problem Statement

Readers and authors alike need various ways to enjoy, appreciate, and analyze literary works.

Readers like to explore and appreciate their favorite reads - beyond reviewing books or talking
about their favorite characters and scenes, readers might create and share in fan art. This
application will allow them to easily create a word-oriented fan art to enjoy on
their own and to share.

Writers also benefit from new ways of looking at their literary works. Word art can
allow writers to analyze their work (language use and frequency). For those who need
visual representations of their work for publicity, word art
can easily be created and used to liven up blog posts, create a vibrant background
to a website or business card, or simply be a visual way to enjoy their work.

### Project Technologies/Techniques

* Security/Authentication
  * Admin: can save and display word art to own account and to public site
  * User: can save word art to their own accounts
  * All: anyone can view admin-created word art (no login)
* Database
  * MySQL
  * Store users and roles
  * Store all data for the words art
* ORM Framework
  * *TBD*
* Dependency Management
  * Maven
* Web Services consumed using Java
  * *TBD*
* CSS
  * self-made, or Bootstrap
* Data Validation
  * built-in CSS front-end validation (or inherent Bootstrap validations)
  * *TBD* (possibly Explore Hibernate's validation)
* Logging
  * Configurable logging using Log4J2
    * In production, only errors will be logged, but debug-level logging can be turned on to facilitate trouble-shooting
* Hosting
  * AWS
* Independent Research Topic/s

  * *TBD* (but the following are likely:)
  * CI tools in AWS
  * API
  * Hibernate Validation
  * Hibernate Search
  * Project Lombok to eliminate boilerplate code like getters/setters/equals
* Unit Testing
  * JUnit tests to achieve 80%+ code coverage
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
